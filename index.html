        <h2>About me:</h2>          
        <p>Born in wyoming in 1985, I currently live in Portland, OR. The northwest has unparalelled beauty and I love getting out of the city and into the outdoors.
          Not long after moving to Oregon I started working professionally as a sound enginner. One job led to the next and eventually I started working directly for bands, 
          accompanying then on tour and running sound for the shows. For the last 10 years I've toured much of the US, Canada and Europe and have been as far as Istanbul. 
          I have made some many great friends and partners over the years and have grown trememdously while out on the road.
